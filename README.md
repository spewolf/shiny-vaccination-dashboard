# United States Vaccine Rollout Dashboard Discussion and Analysis
Spencer Wolf

## Data

My data for this project was downloaded from the OurWorldInData github repository
found here:

https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/vaccinations/us_state_vaccinations.csv

## Methods

I used shiny in order to create an interactable UI that allows average people
to interact with this dataset.

## Results

I was able to create an app with the following features:

- 50 states selectable at the same time for comparison
- A dynamically updating table that gives stats for selected states
- A clear button to quickly wipe selected states
- An interactable plot visualization of how many people have been vaccinated in each
  state over time
- A tooltip to allow for detailed analysis of plot data
